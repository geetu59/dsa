/*Consider the set of irreducible fractions A = {n/d | nâ‰¤d and d and gcd(n,d) = 1}.You are given a member of this set and
your task is to find the largest fraction in this set less than the given fraction. Note: this is a set and so all the members are unique.
Example 1:
Input: n = 1, d = 8 Output: 1249 9993
Explanation: 1/8 >= 1249/9993 and this is the largest fraction.
Expected Time Complexity: O(K) where K <= 104
Expected Space Complexity: O(1) */
